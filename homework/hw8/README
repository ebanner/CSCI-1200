Known bugs:

  The `delelte_test' fails. For some reason, either a city's `neighbors'
  vector gets filled with tons of cities, or the string that represents a name
  of a city belonging to a person gets filled with garbage. The former occurred
  on when we compiled on Xiaohu's computer and the latter occurred when I
  compiled on my computer.
