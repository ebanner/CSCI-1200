CSCI 1200
=========

CSCI 1200 is Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Data Structures course ([Course
Homepage](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/academics/courses/fall12/ds/calendar.html)).

In the 2013 winter Intersession, my friend
[Xiaohu](https://github.com/nianxiaohu) and I slammed out almost all of the
labs and homeworks. Definitely one of the more productive three week stretches
of my life.
